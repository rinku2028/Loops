# Loops
Loops in c#

Looping in programming language is a way to execute a statement or a set of statements multiple number of times depending on the result of condition to be evaluated to execute statements. The result condition should be true to execute statements within loops.

Loops are mainly divided into two categories:
Entry Controlled Loops: The loops in which condition to be tested is present in beginning of loop body are known as Entry Controlled Loops. while loop and for loop are entry controlled loops.

1. while loop The test condition is given in beginning of loop and all statements are executed till the given boolean condition satisfies, when the condition becomes false, the control will be out from the while loop.

2. for loop
for loop has similar functionality as while loop but with different syntax. for loops are preferred when the number of times loop statements are to be executed is known before hand. The loop variable initialization, condition to be tested and increment / decrement of the loop variable is done in one line in for loop thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.

3. do-while loop
do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks the condition after executing the statements, i.e it will execute the loop body one time for sure because it checks the condition after executing the statements.

4.Infinite Loops:
The loops in which the test condition does not evaluate false ever are tend to execute statements forever until an external force is used to end it and thus they are known as infinite loops.

5.continue statement:
continue statement is used to skip over the execution part of loop on a certain condition and move the flow to next updation part.
